Make sure that a file shares its name with its primary class.
Here, MyFirstJava.java has a class "public MyFirstJava".

Next, navigate via terminal to the same folder the java files are in, and type "javac <filename.java>" to compile it

finally, type "java <filename>" to run that java file.

For example, in this folder:
type "javac MyFirstJava.java", which will then create a "MyFirstJava.class" file
Then, type "java MyFirstJava", which should result in the terminal printing "Hello World".
